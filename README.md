# 🐍 eMobilis Week 2 — Python Assessment

This repository contains solutions for **Section Six: Conditional Statements, Data Types & Loops** from the eMobilis Python training program (Week 2 Assessment).

Each task is written as a **stand-alone runnable Python script**, designed to test understanding of control structures, type casting, collections, and iteration in Python.

## 🧩 Topics Covered
Each script demonstrates a key Python concept:

| # | Script | Concept Demonstrated |
|---|---------|----------------------|
| 1 | Age Access Program | Conditional statements & input casting |
| 2 | Admission Fee Calculator | Nested conditions & formatted output |
| 3 | Even or Odd Analyzer | Loops & modulus operator |
| 4 | Grade Classifier | Range checking with `if-elif-else` |
| 5 | Discount Program | Arithmetic operations & formatting |
| 6 | Login Simulation | Logical operators & string comparison |
| 7 | Weekend Detector | Python 3.10+ `match-case` syntax |
| 8 | Collection Sorter | Loop control (`continue`) |
| 9 | Favorite Fruits | Nested loops |
| 10 | Membership Checker | Membership operator `in` |
| 11 | Dictionary Access Validation | Dictionary manipulation |
| 12 | Login Attempts | `while` loop with conditions |
| 13 | Type Identifier | Type casting & `isinstance()` |
| 14 | Score List Evaluator | Counting with loops |
| 15 | Nested Data Lookup | Nested dictionaries & user input |

## 🧠 Learning Objectives

* Apply **conditional statements** (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
* Work with **loops** (`for`, `while`, nested`)
* Use **match-case** control flow
* Handle **type casting** and **user input**
* Perform **list**, **dictionary**, and **string** operations
